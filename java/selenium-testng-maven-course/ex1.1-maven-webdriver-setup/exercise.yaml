  description: |
    Create a Maven project with proper structure and add Selenium, TestNG,
    and WebDriverManager dependencies. Write your first test that opens a
    browser, navigates to a website, and closes the browser.

  must_have:
    - "Standard Maven project structure (src/main/java, src/test/java)"
    - "pom.xml with Selenium dependency"
    - "pom.xml with TestNG dependency"
    - "pom.xml with WebDriverManager dependency"
    - "Test class with @Test annotation"
    - "WebDriver initialization"
    - "Browser navigation (get() or navigate().to())"
    - "Browser cleanup (driver.quit())"

  nice_to_have:
    - "Configuration via config.properties file"
    - "WebDriverManager setup in @BeforeMethod"
    - "Cleanup in @AfterMethod"
    - "Meaningful test class name"
    - "Comments explaining the setup"
