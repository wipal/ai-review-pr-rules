    Navigate to https://demoqa.com/elements and identify 10 different elements
    using various locator strategies (ID, Name, CSS Selector, XPath).
    Create ElementLocators.java class with all locators defined as constants.

  must_have:
    - "ElementLocators.java class created"
    - "At least 10 different locators defined"
    - "Use ID locator for at least 2 elements"
    - "Use Name locator for at least 1 element"
    - "Use CSS Selector for at least 3 elements"
    - "Use XPath for at least 3 elements"
    - "Locators defined as private static final By constants"
    - "Test to validate each locator finds correct element"

  nice_to_have:
    - "Dynamic XPath with contains() function"
    - "Dynamic XPath with text() function"
    - "CSS Selector with attribute combinations"
    - "Comments explaining locator strategy choice"

    ## Summary
    Created ElementLocators class with 10 different locators for DemoQA elements page.

    ## What's done
    - [x] Created ElementLocators.java class
    - [x] Defined 10+ element locators
    - [x] Used ID, Name, CSS, XPath locators
    - [x] Added dynamic XPath with contains/text functions

    ## How to test
    mvn test

  Review Exercise 1.2 (Locator Strategies):
  1. Locator Variety (30 points) - 10+ locators, mix of ID/Name/CSS/XPath
  2. Locator Quality (25 points) - prefer ID, relative XPath, optimized CSS
  3. Code Structure (25 points) - locators as constants, naming, organization
  4. Best Practices (20 points) - comments, dynamic XPath, avoid brittle locators

  Score: 0-100

learning_objectives:

  - "CSS Selectors"
  - "Relative XPath expressions"
  - "XPath functions (contains, text, starts-with)"
